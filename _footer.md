# Additional Resources

For more details on configuring and managing Azure Container Apps and Azure Container App Jobs, refer to the [Azure Container Apps Documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/container-apps/) and [Azure Container Apps Jobs Documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/container-apps/jobs-overview). This module manages Azure Container Apps and Container App Jobs, supporting secure networking, autoscaling, and event-driven workloads for microservices and task-based architectures.

## Resources
- [Terraform Azure Provider Documentation for Container Apps](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/azurerm/latest/docs/resources/container_apps)
- [Azure Container Registry](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/container-registry/)
- [Container Apps Networking](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/container-apps/networking)
- [Terraform Azure Provider Documentation for Container App Jobs](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/azurerm/latest/docs/resources/container_app_job)

## Notes
- Use Scale-to-Zero to optimize costs for idle or low-traffic workloads.
- Apply event or schedule-based triggers using KEDA for dynamic job scaling.
- Store sensitive data securely using environment secrets and managed identities.
- Use revision-based traffic routing for safe rollouts and A/B testing.
- Place apps in virtual networks to manage traffic flow and access control.
- Monitor job runs and define retry and timeout settings for reliability.
- Validate your Terraform configuration to ensure proper deployment of container resources.
